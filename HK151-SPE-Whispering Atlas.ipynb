    "# 2. System Design: Exploratory Performance Analysis of a Buffet Restaurant\n",
    "\n",
    "This document outlines the complete system design for a simulation-based performance evaluation of a buffet restaurant. The design follows a formal 7-step process with a specific focus on identifying performance bottlenecks and quantifying customer wait times.\n",
    "\n",
    "## System Performance Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Define Goal and System\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:**\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to **identify the performance bottleneck** within the four-station buffet system under various workloads. A secondary, but equally important, goal is to **quantify the end-to-end average time a customer spends in the system**. The analysis will be used to propose a resource allocation strategy that mitigates identified bottlenecks and ensures an acceptable customer experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**System:**\n",
    "The system under study is a buffet restaurant modeled as an **Open Queuing Network**. It consists of four distinct service nodes (stations), each with its own queue:\n",
    "*   Drink Station\n",
    "*   Salad Bar\n",
    "*   Main Course Station\n",
    "*   Dessert Station\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Service and Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Service Model:**\n",
    "Each of the four stations is formally modeled as an **M/M/c queuing system**, with a First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) discipline.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Customer Outcomes (Routing Logic):**\n",
    "A customer's journey is governed by two probabilistic mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Initial Station Choice:** A new customer entering the system is routed to their first station according to the probabilities in Table 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "| First Station | Probability |\n",
    "| :--- | :---: |\n",
    "| Main Courses | 40% |\n",
    "| Salad Bar | 30% |\n",
    "| Drink Station | 20% |\n",
    "| Dessert Station | 10% |\n",
    "*Table 1: Probability Distribution for Initial Station Choice*\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Internal Transitions:** After service at any station `i`, a customer's next destination is determined by the transition matrix `P` in Table 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "| From Station | To: Drink | To: Salad | To: Main | To: Dessert | **Depart** |\n",
    "| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n",
    "| **1: Drink** | 0.00 | 0.40 | 0.50 | 0.05 | **0.05** |\n",
    "| **2: Salad** | 0.10 | 0.00 | 0.70 | 0.05 | **0.15** |\n",
    "| **3: Main** | 0.15 | 0.05 | 0.00 | 0.50 | **0.30** |\n",
    "| **4: Dessert** | 0.05 | 0.00 | 0.05 | 0.00 | **0.90** |\n",
    "*Table 2: Internal Transition Probability Matrix ($P_{ij}$)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Select Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Metrics (Goal-Oriented):**\n",
    "*   **Average Total Time in System (`W`):** Directly quantifies the overall customer experience.\n",
    "*   **Average Waiting Time in Queue (`W_q`):** The key indicator used to identify which station is the bottleneck.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Secondary Metrics (Diagnostic):**\n",
    "*   **Server Utilization (`ρ`):** Helps explain *why* a station is a bottleneck.\n",
    "*   **Average Queue Length (`L_q`):** Provides insight into physical congestion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. List System Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a comprehensive list of all parameters that could affect system performance, categorized by type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**System Parameters** (Characteristics of the restaurant design)\n",
    "| Parameter | Description |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Server Counts (`c_i`)** | The number of servers/staff at each station. |\n",
    "| **Routing Matrix (`P_ij`)**| The fixed probabilities of moving between stations. |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workload Parameters** (Characteristics of customer demand)\n",
    "| Parameter | Description |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Arrival Rate (`alpha`)** | The rate of new customers entering the restaurant. |\n",
    "| **Service Times (`t_s_i`)**| The average time a customer needs for service at each station. |\n",
    "| **Initial Choice (`p_i`)**| The probability distribution for a customer's first station choice. |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. List Factors to Study\n",
    "\n",
    "From the comprehensive list in Step 4, we select a subset to intentionally vary in our experiment. These proposals, or **factors**, are chosen for their anticipated high impact on performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Factor 1: Workload Intensity (`alpha`)**\n",
    "*   **Description:** This primary workload parameter is varied to test system robustness under different real-world traffic conditions.\n",
    "*   **Levels (customers/minute):** `{2 (Low), 6 (Medium), 10 (High)}`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Factor 2: Main Course Server Count (`c_main`)**\n",
    "*   **Description:** This system parameter is varied because the Main Course station's long service time and high popularity make it a strong candidate for being a bottleneck.\n",
    "*   **Levels (number of servers):** `{8, 10, 12, 14}`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Factor 3: Salad Bar Server Count (`c_salad`)**\n",
    "*   **Description:** This system parameter is included to investigate potential secondary bottlenecks and understand if reinforcing one station shifts congestion elsewhere.\n",
    "*   **Levels (number of servers):** `{4, 6}`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Factor 4: Dessert Bar Server Count (`c_dessert`)**\n",
    "*   **Description:** This system parameter is included to investigate potential third bottlenecks and understand if reinforcing one station shifts congestion elsewhere.\n",
    "*   **Levels (number of servers):** `{2, 3, 4}`\n",
    "\n",
    "*The total number of experimental scenarios in our full factorial design will be the product of the number of levels for each factor: 3 (workloads) x 4 (main course levels) x 2 (salad bar levels) = **24 unique scenarios**.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Evaluation Technique\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Primary Technique: Discrete-Event Simulation (DES)**\n",
    "*   **Selection Rationale:** We selected DES as our primary tool because it can accurately model the complex, stochastic interactions of a queuing network with feedback loops. It allows for detailed measurement of dynamic metrics (like wait times) that are essential for achieving the project's goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Secondary Technique: Analytical Modeling**\n",
    "*   **Selection Rationale:** We selected Analytical Modeling (Jackson Network Theory) as a supporting technique for **Validation**. The simulation's output for simple, steady-state averages will be compared against the exact values predicted by queuing theory formulas. A close match will validate that the simulation logic is implemented correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Select Workload (and Design Experiment)\n",
    "\n",
    "This final step defines the specific workload values and outlines the formal plan for the simulation experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A. Workload Definition:**\n",
    "The following workload parameters will be held constant for all experiments:\n",
    "*   **Mean Service Times:**\n",
    "    *   Drink Station: 20 seconds\n",
    "    *   Salad Bar: 45 seconds\n",
    "    *   Main Course Station: 60 seconds\n",
    "    *   Dessert Station: 30 seconds\n",
    "*   **Routing Logic:** As defined by the tables in Step 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**B. Experimental Plan:**\n",
    "A **full factorial design** will be executed, covering all 24 unique scenarios generated from the factors and levels in Step 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "**C. Simulation Run Parameters:**\n",
    "*   **Replications:** Each scenario will be simulated **10 times** with different random number seeds.\n",
    "*   **Run Length:** Each simulation will run for **8 hours** (480 minutes) of simulated time.\n",
    "*   **Warm-up Period:** The initial **2 hours** (120 minutes) of each run will be discarded from data collection to allow the system to reach a steady state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**D. Experimental Objectives:**\n",
    "The experiment is designed to specifically answer the questions posed in the project goal:\n",
    "1.  **Identify the Bottleneck:** For each scenario, which station exhibits the longest average wait time (`W_q`) and highest utilization (`ρ`)?\n",
    "2.  **Quantify Customer Waiting Time:** What is the expected Average Total Time in System (`W`) for a customer in each scenario?\n",
    "3.  **Propose an Optimal Configuration:** Based on the results, what combination of server levels provides the best balance between low customer wait times and efficient resource utilization?\n"
